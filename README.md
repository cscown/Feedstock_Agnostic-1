# Feedstock_Agnostic

This project aims to assess the feasibility of a hypothetical "feedstock agnostic" lignocellulosic biorefinery in the US. Such a biorefinery would be capable of accepting different types of lignocellulosic biomass, thus enabling it to operate at high capacity throughout the year.
